### â„¹ General Info
***
In this project we will be setting up real time face detection through a webcam using AI. This AI is so quick that we are able to draw in real time the various faces and expressions of every person in the video without much performance overhead. 

By the end of this video you will have fully functional real time face detection on your site which can be used with any webcam or phone camera. If you want to see a part two of this video make sure to let me know in the comments below.
